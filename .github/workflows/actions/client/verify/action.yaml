    # Native GitHub `actions/download-artifact@v3` doesn't allow sharing between workflows.
    #   - Issue: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/501
    # Once it does, we can use:
    #
    # - name: Client CD - Download CI output
    #   id: cd-download-artifacts
    #   uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
    #   with:
    #     name: ci-build-output
    #     path: |
    #       dist
    #
    # Note that simply adding a `needs`/`uses` block for my-workflow.yaml file doesn't suffice until this is fixed;
    # adding said block for my-action.yaml would (since it's an action and actions are reusable while workflows aren't
    # despite what GitHub claims) but only if that action covers all your needs.
    #
    # We can work around this via:
    #
    # 1. Use a third-party download-artifact action.
    #    Good example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60355925/share-artifacts-between-workflows-github-actions/65049722#65049722
    # - name: Client CD - Download CI output
    #   id: cd-download-artifacts
    #   # needs: [ ci-build-output ]
    #   # needs: [ ci-build-and-upload-artifacts ]
    #   uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2
    #   with:
    #     name: ci-build-output-artifacts
    #     branch: master
    #     github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    #     if_no_artifact_found: fail
    #     workflow_conclusion: success
    #
    # 2. Use a CLI action to manually download artifact files, allowing for more customized artifact selection
    #    without needing to upload files as a release.
    #    Do so via:
    #     - Get latest CI workflow ID via:
    #       gh run list --limit 1 --workflow CI | tail -n +1 | awk '{ print $(NF - 2) }'
    #     - Download all files from that workflow into an arbitrary dir (`ci-workflow-artifact-output` in this case).
    #     - Create the dir we actually want to use (`dist` in this case).
    #     - Copy all nested files/directories from the downloaded dir to the desired dir.
    #     - Delete the original temp dir.
    #    Notes:
    #     - `github.run_id` == Current workflow run ID, not the ID of the run we want (previous workflow run).
